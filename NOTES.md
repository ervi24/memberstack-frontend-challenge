<!-- Tell us about your solution here -->

Hi everyone!
So the idea was to listen a message sent from the host app with the color as a data property.
Then in the iframe app listener set the state for the color property to change the background on the chat-bot icon.
Right now the solution changes the color of the color-picker and stores the value on the local storage to persist the value.
I had an issue sending the message to the iframe, after solving this issue, the color change should work.

And that's it. Thanks a lot, and I'm all ears for any suggestion you have.
